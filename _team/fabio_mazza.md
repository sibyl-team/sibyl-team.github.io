I'm a PhD student in Physics at Politecnico di Torino, in the DISAT department and a member of the SmartData@Polito interdipartmental center. I have received my Master's Degree from Politecnico di Torino in Physics of Complex Systems in 2019, with a double degree program including the Paris VII – Denis Diderot university (now called Université de Paris). 

My research is centered on inference methods derived from statistical physics in the context of dynamical processes occurring on large scale networks.

Apart from statistical physics and complex networks, I'm also interested in topics like Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning, and their applications.
