I'm a physicist. My current areas of research are inference problems, statistical mechanics, epidemic spreading and urban science. I'm the creator and webmaster of the [CityChrone](http://www.citychrone.org) project.
I'm currently a post-doc researcher at the Politecnico of Turin, in the DISAT department and at [SmartData@poliTO](https://smartdata.polito.it/).
