## Sibyl Team
### Statistical inference team

Development of statistical methods mutuated from  statistical physics of complex system and machine learning techniques to solve inference problems in dynamic processes.
The methods and algorithms developed allow to address several inference problems in epidemics like, the individuation of the patient zero, the epidemic reconstructions problem, the risk estimation and the inference of the epidemic parameters that govern the spreading process.
